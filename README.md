# **Tennis Sports Analytics: Court Line Detection**

## **Overview**

This project leverages **pretrained deep learning models** to detect and analyze court lines in tennis matches. By applying computer vision techniques, the goal is to automatically identify court boundaries, which can be used for performance analysis, automated refereeing, and game strategy insights.

## **Key Features**
- **Court Line Detection**: Utilizes pretrained models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to detect lines on the tennis court.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes video footage to identify and track ball movement relative to court boundaries.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes court line detection results on the original video footage.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and video handling
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For deep learning model deployment
- **Pretrained Models**: YOLO, Faster R-CNN for object detection
